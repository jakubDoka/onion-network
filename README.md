# Orion network

## Setup

To run the project, execute the `serve.sh [release]` you can set an environment variable `TEST_WALLETS` where you put wallet adresses of the polkadot accounts you want to use while testing separated by commas, the chain will deposit sufficient funds there atomatically, otherwise you would need to do this manually.

## Big TODOs

- [ ] - Switch to Falcon for smaller signatures
